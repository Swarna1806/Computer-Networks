Assignment 4:
 
 >> The doc containg a link for the scheduling algorithm files (name as - Algorithms file link)
   > It contains 4 files, each having a code corresponding to the scheduling algorithm as named on it.
    . WFQ.cpp
    .Round Robin.cpp
    .Prioirty.cpp
    .iSLIP.cpp
    
 >> The link is followed by the explanation of each of the scheduling algorithms and the outputs that we have obtained(screenshots)
 >> This was done for all the 4 algorithms
 >> Followed by a comparison in different traffic scenarios
 
 >> Questions that were asked in the assignment were answered below
 
 >> Concluded with a Overall comparison maetrics for all the 4 scheduling algorithms
