This zip file consists of a pdf and 3 tasks files (1 for each task)
task1.cpp ->1st task
task2_ass5.cpp -> 2nd task
task3.cpp -> 3rd task

The pdf file contains the detailed description of the implementation of all the 3 tasks, and the outputs otained upon executing them.
The screenshots of the outputs that we got are attached in the pdf.

To run the task files , (on linux)
 /// g++ task_file_name.cpp
 //// ./a.out
 
 
 the output will be displayed on the terminal as similar to the screenshots that are there in the pdf.
 
 (for the task 2 , we implemented using 0-based indexing, and 1- based indexing for the the remaining 2 tasks)
